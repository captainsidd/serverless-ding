# serverless-ding

# Why
Because running `sls deploy` is just long enough to go do something else and forget that you ran `sls deploy`. Figured a notification would be nice.

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed before starting:
* [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm?utm_source=house&utm_medium=homepage&utm_campaign=free%20orgs&utm_term=Install%20npm)
* [serverless](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/installation/)

# Things To Do Before We're Done Here
 * Play different sounds on (un)successful deploy
 * Let user choose what sounds to play
 * Notifications from Terminal for macOS (like Chrome notifications)
 * Support operating systems besides macOS
 * Unit tests
 * Linting
 * Publish to npm
 * Badges in the README

# Attribution

The sound effect `doorbell.wav` was taken from [here](https://freesound.org/people/Corsica_S/sounds/163730/)
